Sobel operator (edge detecting filter) (implemented with opencv)
Photometric Stereo 
Lambertian (perfectly "matte"), Oren-Nayar models (lambertian + spectral highlights + something else)
Gabor filter, Otsu's method
Bayesian Network, RANSAC
Successive Over Relaxation (solves linear least squares)

can you create a pseudo lambertian surface if your lighting is sufficiently diffused?

Camera with known GPS coord and orientation (direction). Facing away from the sun, with a method of knowing how cloudy it is (forcast, mirror, watever). Knowing the time -> sun position -> light source vector. Take pictures throughout the day. Combine into 3d map. if looking down upon a plot, can generate some sort of point cloud or at least a DEM. but why?

- (pg 6) VWF (variable window filter): uses known height:crown_diamter ratio to deliminate trees. uses point cloud. 
- Matches differently object scaled differently but similar in shape to the mexican hat (which matches a confer shape). SWE. Does not need ratio.

- uses CHM (canopy height model) to find tree centerpoints using local maxes. uses centerpoints to create voronoi diagrams, compares the edges to the negative slope (valley) points from the image, uses that to estimate tree area.

Photometric Stereo, lambertian reflectance.
use differences in light diffusivity (reflectivity)
to find diff's between ground and trees, different types of trees

- using phtometric stereo to make 3d models of leaves, then finding the viens 
- and making images of just the veins. used for categorization.
- Math wise: they create the 3d model like any other Photometric Stereo, then
- apply a function to tell you how "rutty" or "ridgey" it is, extract it,
- apply some (Gabor filter, Otsu's method) math, and done. disregards infections
- , anything that changes leaf color. Just looks at 3d model.

- "this has lead to the simplifying assumption that a leaf may be considered a diffuse, lambertian reflector".

- can use 3 cameras, one R, one B, one G, and take a single RGB picture. Seperate later.

- DiLiGenT dataset for testing, comparison

- would possibly work for finding sunlight vectors
