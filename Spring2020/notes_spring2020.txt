spectral resampling
what would landsat see relative to the neon data?
- is there a correction factor you can apply to landsat to make it more like neon?

planet data compared to landsat
- research and education licence to get planet data
- SD10x or 3K 3R 3S preferable for data b/c much better separation of r/g/b bands
- - 4 Band PlanetScope, PS2 SD
- linear regression, gain & something
- - Fit both to a polynomial, comapare coefficients?

indeces that use RGB & NIR, look at the correlation b/n that and landsat (historgram_ before and after adjustement. after adjustement it should move on top
- k mean sclustering

get a number of planet scenes with the same wavelengths (?) and compare it to eachother.
Same sensor measuring the same bands, 

spectral adjustement with two sensors from the same day - if it's the same you can use it for every one otherwise you have to do it individually

I am interested in comparing Planet data to Landsat data, in an effort to artificially increase Landsat's accuracy and decrease it's pixel size. If I can find a semi-consistent method of adjustment,  the Landsat data with it's many spectra can be improved beyond it's large pixel size.
